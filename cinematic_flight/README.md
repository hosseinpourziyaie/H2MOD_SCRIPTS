# Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2 Campaign Remastered Scripted Cinematic Flight Travel

## Installation 
Just copy script folder in "game directory\scripts" then youre good to go :)

## How it Works?

- It spawns script_model then it links player to that entity. it starts moving camera in pathz instructed in flight script 

## Notes

- This Script is Just portation of my previous iw6x cinematic flight travel script over to modded mw2cr. It still took about 14 hours of effort to make it work 
- for Recording Travel Pathz you can use dev tool that I have added in end of script(commented out by default)


## TODO

- Add User-Handler start button
- Add Bezier Flight feature
- Record flight scripts for other maps 

## Showcase

- I will try upload video for it later
